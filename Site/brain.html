            <h2>The Human Brain</h2>
            <p>
                The brain is the part of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Similar to the central tower at an airport. Your brain acts as it's is control center, directing all the comings and goings of information processes and impulses. The brain has three major areas: the <span>brain stem</span>, the <span>cerebellum</span> and the <span>cerebral cortex</span> (both the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex starts with cere. Latin from 'wax' because of it's waxy appearance).
            </p>
            <p>
                The brain is made up of fat and water, weighs approximately three pounds, and facicilates incredible power and ability.
            </p>
            <h3>The Brain Stem</h3>
            <p>
                The bran stem moderates the basic function Human need to live, such as breathing, mataining a regular heath rate, impulses to eat of have sex and our fight-or-flight reponses. It is located at the top of the spine and the base of the skull, buried deep within the brain.
            </p>
            <h3>The Cerebellum</h3>
            <p>
                At the back of the brain, the cerebellum is responsible for moderating movement and coordination. There's also increasing evidence that it plays a role in our decision making.
            </p>
            <h3>The Cerebral Cortex</h3>
            <p>The cerebral cortex is the largest part of Human brain, where the majority of our complex thinking, short-term memory, and sensory stimulation takes place. It is made up of the <a href="#" class="occ-lobe">Occipital</a>, <a href="#" class="par-lobe">Parietal</a>, <a href="#" class="temp-lobe">Temporal</a> and <a href="#" class="fron-lobe">Frontal lobes</a>.</p><br/>
            <p>
                Our frontal lobes are where most of our thinking takes place; where logic and creativity derive.
                The brain is spilt into two halves that are connected by <span>Corpus Callosum</span>, which acts like a bundle of telephone wires between the lobes, sending messages back and forth. Right now, you have somewhere around 86 billion neurons (also called brain cells) firing and acting together in concert as ypu read these words and assimilate the information on these pages. These neural signals are released into the brain and received by neurotransmitters which then pass the message along to other neurotransmitters or stop the message altogether if that's the appropriate response.
                Our brain is malleable. We have the incredible ability to change it's structure and organization over time ny forming new neural pathways as we experience, learn something new and adapt.

            <h2>NeuroPlasticity</h2>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity also refered to as brain plasticity means that eveytime you learn something new, your brain makes a synaptic connection, and each time this happens your brain physically changes. It upgrades it's hardware to reflect a new level of the mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity or ability of the brain to reorganize and transform itself as it is exposed to learning, and new experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is dependent on the ability of our neurons to grow make connections with other neurons in other parts of the brain. It works by making new connections and strenthening(or weakening, as the case may be) old ties.

                    <h4>The Occipital Lobe</h4>
                    <p>
                        Occipital lobe is one of the four major lobes of the <span>cerebral cortex</span> Human brain. The <span>occipital lobe</span> is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex. The primary visul cortex is Brodmann area 17, commonly called V1(visual one).

                    <h4>The Parietal Lobe</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parietal lobe is one of the major lobes in the brain, roughly located at the upper back area in the skull. It processes snesory information it receives from the outside world, mainly relating to touch, taste, and temperature. Damage to the parital lobe may lead to dysfunction in the senses.

                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Temporal lobe is the lower lobe of the cortex, sitting close to ear level within the skull. It is largely responsible for creating and preserving both conscious and long-term memory. The temporal lobes are also believed to play and important role in processing affects/emotions language, and certain aspects of the visual cortex.

                        <p>
                            Frontal lobe is the part of the brain that controls important congnitive skills in Human, such as emotional expression, problem solving, memory, language, judgement and sexual behaviours. It is in essence the 'control panel' of our personality and our ability to communicate.
